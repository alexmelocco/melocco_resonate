# This is my take on the Contacts page for the Resonate Technical assessment

This is my take on the contacts page for the Resonate technical assessment. I completed it using the React Library and used the Axios library to access to the contact data from the provided API

# Overview

- Simple design that displays the contact information as contact cards in a grid/list depending on the window size

# Features/Design

- Responsive design - responsive on all ui sizes
- Simple UI - clean and straightforward
- Search bar - can filter by name
- toggle list/grid style view - dynamic and allows either style based on preference

# Deployment 

- Deployed on github pages - just for convinience and ease of access

# Code itself
-  main functionality is in the folder src/components.

# Basic operation (normal commands)
- `npm start`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run eject`
